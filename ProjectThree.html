            <p id="bold">Why Use Java?</p>
            <p>Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world</li>
                <li>It has a large demand in the current job market</li>
                <li>It is easy to learn and simple to use</li>
                <li>It is open-source and free</li>
                <li>It is secure, fast and powerful</li>
                <li>It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)</li>
                <li>Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs</li>
                <li>As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa</li>

            <p>There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="bold">Standalone Application:</span> Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.</li>
                <li><span id="bold">Web Application:</span> An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.</li>
                <li><span id="bold">Enterprise Application:</span> An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.</li>
                <li><span id="bold">Mobile Application:</span> An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="bold">Java Platforms / Editions</p>
            <p>There are 4 platforms or editions of Java:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="bold">Java SE (Java Standard Edition)</span> It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math, etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.</li>
                <li><span id="bold">Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)</span> It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.</li>
                <li><span id="bold">Java ME (Java Micro Edition)</span> It is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile applications.</li>
                <li><span id="bold">JavaFX</span> It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a lightweight user interface API.</li>

        <section id="Features_of_Java" class="main-section">
            <header>Features of Java</header>
            <p>The primary objective of Java programming language creation was to make it portable, simple and secure programming language. Apart from this, there are also some excellent features which play an important role in the popularity of this language. The features of Java are also known as Java buzzwords.
            <br>A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple</li>
                <li>Object-Oriented</li>
                <li>Portable</li>
                <li>Platform independent</li>
                <li>Secured</li>
                <li>Robust</li>
                <li>Architecture neutral</li>
                <li>Interpreted</li>
                <li>High Performance</li>
                <li>Multithreaded</li>
                <li>Distributed</li>
                <li>Dynamic</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span id="bold">1) Simple</span><br>
            Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).</li>
                <li>Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.</li>
                <li>There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span id="bold">2) Object-oriented</span><br>Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.<br>Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.<br>Basic concepts of OOPs are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Object</li>
                <li>Class</li>
                <li>Inheritance</li>
                <li>Polymorphism</li>
                <li>Abstraction</li>
                <li>Encapsulation</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span id="bold">3) Platform Independent</span><br>Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.<br>There are two types of platforms: software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.<br>The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Runtime Environment</li>
                <li>API(Application Programming Interface)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere(WORA).</p>

        <section id="Difference_between_JDK_JRE_and_JVM" class="main-section">
            <header>Difference between JDK JRE and JVM</header>
            <p id="bold">Java Development Kit (JDK)</p>
            <p>The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit used to develop applications in Java programming language. It is the most widely used Java Software Development Kit. It contains JRE + development tools.</p>
            <p id="bold">Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</p>
            <p>JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is used to provide runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.</p>
            <p id="bold">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</p>
            <p>JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (so JVM is platform dependent).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>JVM, JRE and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. However, Java is platform independent.</li>
                <li>The JVM performs the following main tasks:</li>
                <li>Loads code</li>
                <li>Verifies code</li>
                <li>Executes code</li>
                <li>Provides runtime environment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>JVM provides definitions for the:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Specification</li>
                <li>Implementation</li>
                <li>Runtime Instance</li>
